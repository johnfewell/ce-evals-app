## Issues

- [ ] Evaluations' questions: should not be able to edit questions that are assigned to an eval. You should only be able to see questions that you have created.  
- [ ] make dashboard page for superadmin
- [ ] The evaluation answer page looks terrible
- [ ] Add some page for new users who aren't assigned yet, make it so they can't take many actions on the site
- [ ] Make it so that you can't reassign evaluations once there are associated finished_evaluations
- [ ] make it so you can't fill out an evaluation for the same course twice as the same user
- [ ] Finish auth stuff
- [ ] Improve report view
- [ ] Eliminate unneeded routes
